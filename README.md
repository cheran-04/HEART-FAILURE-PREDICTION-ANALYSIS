The study surveyed machine learning algorithms to predict cardiac outcomes using patient data. In tested models including logistic regression, 
decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), gradient enhancers (GBM), and neural networks, the gradient model showed very high accuracy, 
and it achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.85. The superior performance of the gradient-enhancing model confirms the ability of group learning methods, especially boosting, 
to predict cardiomyopathy by repeatedly improving the weaknesses of the individual model, GBM was able to achieve higher predictive accuracy. This highlights the 
importance of the usefulness of clustering methods, especially in situations with complex data sets and different types of forecast variables.

The study shows that data integration, real-time analytics, personalized risk assessment, and longitudinal assessment can further increase the accuracy of 
cardiovascular prediction. In addition, efforts to improve model translation capabilities and integration with electronic health records for easy clinical use 
and improve patient outcomes and health care efficiency are recommended. So, the study strongly recommends further research and development of gradient enhancement 
and ensemble methods for cardiac prediction, with the aim of moving patient outcomes in cardiac arrest effectiveness. Future research could focus on refining 
the GBM algorithm or exploring ensemble methods in combination with other advanced methods to achieve even greater accuracy.
